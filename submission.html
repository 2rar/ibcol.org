                    <h2>Problem & Solution (30%):</h2>
                    project addresses an appropriate problem properly. The problem is a complex challenge that involves
                    various parties where incentives must be provided for coordination, reconciliation, and so forth.
                    The solution must make sense to use a blockchain, rather than one that is oriented around a
                    conventional cloud solution or database infrastructure. Commercial (15 points): the problem exists
                    due to insufficient trust and the effort to build that trust is an insurmountable obstacle without
                    the use of some technology to help coordinate and reconcile. Technical (15 points): the solution
                    shows that blockchain can address the problem better than other technologies.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Market & Partners (10%):</h2>
                    project includes the appropriate collaboration properly. The market is the collective size of the
                    problem in quantitative terms, which further justifies the problem and provides a basis for revenue
                    projections and distribution plans. A market is usually measured in terms of potential revenue,
                    potential spending, potential users, or similar data. The partners are the entities that must be
                    present for the solution to work — contestants need not have any relationship with potential
                    partners. Typically, these are domain operators and regulators. A complete paper would describe the
                    roles, responsibilities, and incentives of these partners.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Competition & Risks (20%):</h2>
                    project is transparent about its potential vulnerabilities. Competition may be direct (any product
                    or service that does the same thing), very direct (other blockchain projects), or indirect (can even
                    be alternative processes). A complete paper may not necessarily explain why the proposed project is
                    the best, but why it is different and therefore better. Risks are all risks facing the proposed
                    project. Usually, the biggest risks are non-cooperation or non-alignment of incentives of partners.
                    Other risks include technical, execution, business, and other risks that may be encountered by any
                    business plan.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Architecture & Governance (30%):</h2>
                    project has appropriate design fundamentals. Architecture refers to the technical design of the
                    project. Justify why a certain blockchain platform or type of blockchain is preferred. How it
                    interacts with non-blockchain systems, especially legacy processes and systems, technical or
                    otherwise. Governance refers to how the project managed: network membership governance, technology
                    infrastructure governance, and business network governance. Chapter 5 in the Blockchain for Business
                    book by Arun, Cuomo, Gaur perfectly describes this concept. Asset tokenization may fall under this
                    category, which is how non-blockchain ready, or even non-digital “things” are represented faithfully
                    and consistently on the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Value & Distribution (10%):</h2>project has value and can be brought into reality. Value is
                    about how the project generates value, which may not always be revenue or money. Distribution is
                    about how the project will go to market and what the next steps would be.</p>

                    <h2>Individual Eligibility </h2>Any current or recent student may register as a competitor.. A
                    current student is defined as a person of any age that is enrolled in a recognized academic
                    institution. A recent student would have been a current student until 3 years ago (July 5th, 2017).
                    An individual may be attached to an academic institution by being ever enrolled in it. A recognized
                    institution is an accredited educational institution or an institution that may grant a degree or
                    diploma. All institutions and competitors must be registered with the IBCOL Registrar Office.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Team Eligibility </h2>Projects are submitted by teams of one to six eligible competitors. Each
                    team must nominate one representative academic institution, if any of the team members are from
                    different academic institutions. This representative institution determines which country or
                    territory the team and thus project will represent. Teams may be composed of members from different
                    countries/territories or academic institutions.</p>

                    a team is registered. Next, a project is registered. A team may submit more than one project. Each
                    local Blockchain Olympiad committee has different schedules. Thus, pay attention to the criteria for
                    the deadlines of each local Blockchain Olympiad committee.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Project Evaluation</h2> The representative academic institution determines the country, and thus
                    determines which local Blockchain Olympiad committee will evaluate your whitepaper. Thus, pay
                    attention to the criteria for the requirements of each local Blockchain Olympiad committee.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Project Selection</h2>Each local Blockchain Olympiad committee may select up to 12 teams to
                    represent their locale. Some select only on the basis of whitepaper quality, some also evaluate
                    posterboard presentations and even pitch presentations. Some have additional interviews. Some have
                    national or regional competitions. Thus, pay attention to the criteria for the processes of each

                    our interactions. There are best practices that we have been following since we started using Zoom
                    years ago, such as having password-protected sessions or registered accounts only. Furthermore, Zoom
                    has already patched many of its security issues. For all intents and purposes, it is safe.</p>

                        compliant and sustainable way. Deep thinking is more important.</p>
