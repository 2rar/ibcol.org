                <hr>

                    <h1>How are projects evaluated in IBCOL 2022?</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-7">
                    <p><h2>Problem & Solution (30%):</h2>
                        project addresses an appropriate problem properly. The problem is a complex challenge that involves various parties where incentives must be provided for coordination, reconciliation, and so forth. The solution must make sense to use a blockchain, rather than one that is oriented around a conventional cloud solution or database infrastructure. Commercial (15 points): the problem exists due to insufficient trust and the effort to build that trust is an insurmountable obstacle without the use of some technology to help coordinate and reconcile. Technical (15 points): the solution shows that blockchain can address the problem better than other technologies.</p>

                    <p><h2>Market & Partners (10%):</h2>
                        project includes the appropriate collaboration properly. The market is the collective size of the problem in quantitative terms, which further justifies the problem and provides a basis for revenue projections and distribution plans. A market is usually measured in terms of potential revenue, potential spending, potential users, or similar data. The partners are the entities that must be present for the solution to work — contestants need not have any relationship with potential partners. Typically, these are domain operators and regulators. A complete paper would describe the roles, responsibilities, and incentives of these partners.</p>
                    
                    <p><h2>Competition & Risks (20%):</h2>
                        project is transparent about its potential vulnerabilities. Competition may be direct (any product or service that does the same thing), very direct (other blockchain projects), or indirect (can even be alternative processes). A complete paper may not necessarily explain why the proposed project is the best, but why it is different and therefore better. Risks are all risks facing the proposed project. Usually, the biggest risks are non-cooperation or non-alignment of incentives of partners. Other risks include technical, execution, business, and other risks that may be encountered by any business plan.</p>
                    
                    <p><h2>Architecture & Governance (30%):</h2>
                        project has appropriate design fundamentals. Architecture refers to the technical design of the project. Justify why a certain blockchain platform or type of blockchain is preferred. How it interacts with non-blockchain systems, especially legacy processes and systems, technical or otherwise. Governance refers to how the project managed: network membership governance, technology infrastructure governance, and business network governance. Chapter 5 in the Blockchain for Business book by Arun, Cuomo, Gaur perfectly describes this concept. Asset tokenization may fall under this category, which is how non-blockchain ready, or even non-digital “things” are represented faithfully and consistently on the blockchain.</p>                        
                    <p><h2>Value & Distribution (10%):</h2>project has value and can be brought into reality. Value is about how the project generates value, which may not always be revenue or money. Distribution is about how the project will go to market and what the next steps would be.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-7">
                    <p><h2>Individual Eligibility </h2>Any current or recent student may register as a competitor.. A current student is defined as a person of any age that is enrolled in a recognized academic institution. A recent student would have been a current student until 3 years ago (July 5th, 2017). An individual may be attached to an academic institution by being ever enrolled in it. A recognized institution is an accredited educational institution or an institution that may grant a degree or diploma. All institutions and competitors must be registered with the IBCOL Registrar Office.</p>
                    <p><h2>Team Eligibility </h2>Projects are submitted by teams of one to six eligible competitors. Each team must nominate one representative academic institution, if any of the team members are from different academic institutions. This representative institution determines which country or territory the team and thus project will represent. Teams may be composed of members from different countries/territories or academic institutions.</p>

                        <p><h2>Project Registration</h2>Individuals must first register with the IBCOL Registrar Office. Next, a team is registered. Next, a project is registered. A team may submit more than one project. Each local Blockchain Olympiad committee has different schedules. Thus, pay attention to the criteria for the deadlines of each local Blockchain Olympiad committee.</p>
                        <p><h2>Project Evaluation</h2> The representative academic institution determines the country, and thus determines which local Blockchain Olympiad committee will evaluate your whitepaper. Thus, pay attention to the criteria for the requirements of each local Blockchain Olympiad committee.</p>
                        <p><h2>Project Selection</h2>Each local Blockchain Olympiad committee may select up to 12 teams to represent their locale. Some select only on the basis of whitepaper quality, some also evaluate posterboard presentations and even pitch presentations. Some have additional interviews. Some have national or regional competitions. Thus, pay attention to the criteria for the processes of each local Blockchain Olympiad committee.</p>

                        <p>Most types of research poster templates have similar components. There’s no standard when it comes to these types of posters.

                        <p><h2>Is it safe to use Zoom?</h2>
                            Yes. The public consensus is that Zoom is not safe for secrets, but there are no secrets shared in our interactions. There are best practices that we have been following since we started using Zoom years ago, such as having password-protected sessions or registered accounts only. Furthermore, Zoom has already patched many of its security issues. For all intents and purposes, it is safe.</p>

                        <p>Yes, the IBCOL is suitable for any discipline. Deep technical understanding of blockchain is not as important as knowing how blockchain can be used and what are the challenges of using it in a compliant and sustainable way. Deep thinking is more important.</p>
