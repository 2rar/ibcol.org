                About the International Blockchain Olympiad</h3>
              <p>What is IBCOL?
                The International Blockchain Olympiad (IBCOL) is an annual global competition inviting current and recent students to propose solutions for real-world problems with blockchain technology. In a worldwide hunt for blockchain talent, IBCOL combines the practicality of case competitions with the open-ended problem-solving culture of hack-a-thons, where participants submit a whitepaper like an academic conference and implementations of capstone projects.</p>  
            </div>

            <h3>
              What is it like to compete in IBCOL?
            </h3>
            <p>
              IBCOL embodies the characteristics of a business case competition, an academic whitepaper conference, and a "hackathon" — contestants of up to six current and recent students first write a whitepaper to describe a complete solution, and finalists are required to create a poster board and a pitch presentation. This competition design rewards the students who can think deeply about a problem and the solution, and explain it to others in a coherent manner.

              <h3>What is the mission of IBCOL?</h3>
              <p>The mission of the International Blockchain Olympiad is to support sustainability and maturity in blockchain by working with academic, industry, and government partners. Primarily working with secondary and tertiary students, IBCOL provides education and training on designing complete blockchain solutions.</p>

            <div>
              <h3>How does IBCOL accomplish its mission?</h3>
              <p>Promoting Awareness on Blockchain Technology & Applications: students from around the world will benefit from the experience of participating in the IBCOL program of activities, which includes seminar series, specialised training and workshops, mentoring, and networking events besides the actual competitions. This will cultivate a genuine interest in the area of innovation, originality, creativity and cutting-edge technology. It will also instill the right ethical values in the younger generation to pave the way for their further exploration of blockchain in the future.
              <p>Enhancing Employability by Equipping Participants with helpful Skills: the prospective and actual participants will benefit tremendously from the IBCOL programme, as they learn practical skills and knowledge outside their disciplines and push the boundaries of their comfort zones. Students get a taste of the real world, and learn how to identify and overcome challenges in actually making something happen.</p></div>

              <h3>When did IBCOL start?</h3>
              <p>The IBCOL was founded in 2017 at the height of the cryptocurrency bubble. While most of the world was distracted by ill-conceived ideas or outright scams, the IBCOL was one of the few that dared to ignore short-term gain for long-term development of the blockchain ecosystem. In its third year, IBCOL 2020 will be held online in the GMT+8 timezone. Participating countries may send up to 12 projects in a three-day symposium this July.</p>

            <div>
              <h3> Why does IBCOL matter?</h3>
              <p>The International Blockchain Olympiad (IBCOL) creates value for the students, for their academic institutions, for their potential employers, for their country, and for the entire world. </p>
              <p>Building a Talent Trust: The purpose of this event is to nurture the next generation of blockchain professionals around the world. Participants have the opportunity to learn about blockchain from nothing and apply their knowledge in a design competition to see where they stand with their peers worldwide. Historically, participants of IBCOL have been offered jobs, internships, and investments into their projects with great continual success.
              </p>
              <p>Braving a Whole New World: The world is increasingly online, and this paradigm shift will be accelerated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data is the new oil and identity is the new money. The last decade saw lots of development on the information superhighway, but this decade will see a crackdown on bad drivers. Privacy is in the spotlight now, due to the Facebook scandal and the implementation of GDPR. The next frontier is data verifiability, where blockchain is a fundamental part of the ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Addressing Humanity's Challenges: With the decentralization of training and organization to the national level worldwide this year, the first generations of certified and compliant blockchain professionals in many countries will trace their inception to IBCOL 2020. Many of these students will build the foundations of the trust economy in their countries. In due time, this community will catalyst the cross-border solutions to problems postulated by the UN SDG and other non-profit organizations.
              </p>
              <p>The Time for Blockchain is NOW: As a technology of trust, blockchain will generate 3.1 billion USD in value across all industry verticals. Countries across the world are directly and implicitly forming national development strategies around blockchain. There is already a lack of qualified blockchain professionals around the world today. Just like how today’s big tech did not emerge at the start of the internet revolution, the most influential blockchain giants of tomorrow do not yet exist today.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Time for Students to get into Blockchain is NOW: When students of today graduate a few years from now, there will be even more job opportunities in blockchain. As students and graduates seek the hottest jobs and employers fight over the best talent, the next ten years will resemble the internet boom in the 1990s.

              <h3>How is IBCOL organized?</h3>
              <p> The IBCOL family is a network of organizations, consisting of three levels: the core IBCOL, the Local Blockchain Olympiad Committees (X-BCOL), and the IBCOL School Chapters.</p>
           <p>Local Blockchain Olympiad Committees: The X-BCOL is the highest authority representing IBCOL in their country or territory. These great powers come with the most important responsibility: nomination of national representatives for the Final Round of the International Blockchain Olympiad, or IBCOL Finals. To ensure travelling to-and-from and at the IBCOL Finals, the X-BCOL is advised to submit their nominees within a reasonable time to allot for due diligence of projects by the IBCOL Competitions Committee (within one week), the issuance of tourist visas if applicable (4-6 weeks), and making travel arrangements (flights, hotels, etc). The X-BCOL are only required to submit up to 12 projects to represent their country. An actual event — online or extravagant or otherwise — is not required, but recommended if budget permits. The X-BCOL should maintain close relationships with each School Chapter. The X-BCOL are encouraged to fundraise for their operations, but work closely with IBCOL to ensure the expectation of supporting organizations are managed well.</p>
             <p>School Chapters: The IBCOL School Chapters are the official representatives of IBCOL and their X-BCOL in each academic institution. The primary objective of School Chapters is to create opportunities for like-minded students to participate and collaborate in the IBCOL programme.
